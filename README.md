# Optimal Brownian Inventory Control: A Distillation

See [manuscript](https://github.com/Shkev/optimal-brownian-control/blob/main/Brownian_Control.pdf).

An intuition-driven introduction to Brownian control algorithms. Knowledge of stochastics and stochastic calculus are helpful to understand but not necessary, beyond basic knowledge of probability and experience with mathematics.

Distillation of Brownian inventory control algorithms under convex holding cost and linear proportional adjustment cost as originally presented [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2831) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6572).

Applying the control algorithm in the impulse control case (i.e., there is a cost to making adjustments to the process) looks something like this:
